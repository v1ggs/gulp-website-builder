## GENERAL INFO

> If you want to use this repository it is required that you're familiar with Gulp and Javascript.
> It is also recommended that you're familiar with the node modules it uses.
>
> If you're familiar with Gulp and JavaScript then it's very easy for you to add new modules or modify modules behaviour.
>
> Try not to modify any other but `config.js` files, unless you know what you are doing.
>
> Configuration files (`config.js`) are commented for explanations, which should be fine for most people familiar with Gulp and JavaScript. Almost everything is configurable.
>
> If you're developing with WordPress, you have to have a local WordPress site (with local server, like XAMPP) to proxy it with browsersync, because browsersync can't serve php. The settings for that are made automatically, just edit the project and wp config.
>
> Use TODOs like: `TODO:` or `FIXME:` in an appropriate comment (ex: // TODO: change this), to get all todos and fixmes in a .txt file in the root dir.\
> Read more at: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-todo>
