## FEATURES

- :information_source: unzip automatically [underscores theme template](https://underscores.me)
- :information_source: :information_source: replace placeholder slug and text-domain automatically, in all files, if using a "placeholder" theme
- theme is initialised automatically:
  - directory
  - style.css
  - index.php
  - screenshot placeholder
- copy files to the destination on any file change
- populate all TODOs and FIXMEs from .php files into LOG-TODO-WP.txt, in the ".log/" dir
- update [humans.txt](https://humanstxt.org/) on each build

> This may look like an ordinary duplication of files, but I believe it's better to keep all source files in one place.
>
> :information_source: If you want to use underscores starter theme, then download it first, place it into the wordpress source dir, make all required configurations, and then run gulp. It will be unzipped and all config done automatically.
>
> :information_source: :information_source: Placeholder theme would be a theme that is created once, and used for all projects, with some particular name, which is used as theme slug and text domain placeholder which is easy to replace whithout errors.\
> It is always a good idea to download a new starter theme for each new project, because they maintain (update) it.
